1.First, define a method called GetResult that takes three parameters: x, y, and operators. This method will perform the operation on x and y based on the operator provided.

2.Inside the GetResult method, use a switch statement to handle the different operators (+, -, *, /).

3.For each operator, perform the operation on x and y and assign the result to the result variable.

4.Finally, return the result variable from the GetResult method.

The GetResult method uses a switch statement to perform the desired operation based on the value of the operater variable. The method then returns the result of the operation.

In the Main method, the GetResult method is called with two input values and an operator. The result of the operation is stored in the result variable and then printed to the console.

This code provides a way to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) on two input numbers, using a user-defined operator.

The code uses a basic form of object-oriented programming. The ArthmaticCalculator class encapsulates the functionality of performing arithmetic operations. By using this class, the code can be easily extended to support additional arithmetic operations in the future.
